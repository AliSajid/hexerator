# Hexerator
Versatile GUI hex editor focused on binary file exploration and aiding pattern recognition. Written in Rust.

Check out [the Hexerator book](https://crumblingstatue.github.io/hexerator-book/) for a detailed list of features, and more!

## Note for contributors:
Hexerator only supports latest nightly Rust. You need an up-to-date nightly to build Hexerator.
As Hexerator matures, it will slowly transition to stable Rust.
The plan is for Hexerator 1.0 to be buildable with a stable Rust version.
